This is an example of how to use AVIOU in single-page applications. In this case, we've made a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to demonstrate how to use the AVIOU web-component here. It is possible to our web-component in other frameworks as well.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the default index page.

## The Examples

There are 4 examples of using AVIOU catalogues with our web-component. They are located here in the source code:

- pages/catalogue-a.tsx
- pages/catalogue-b.tsx
- pages/switch-catalogue.tsx
- pages/two-catalogues.tsx

The urls for those are:

- [http://localhost:3000/catalogue-a](http://localhost:3000/cataloge-a)
- [http://localhost:3000/catalogue-b](http://localhost:3000/cataloge-b)
- [http://localhost:3000/switch-catalogue](http://localhost:3000/switch-cataloge)
- [http://localhost:3000/two-catalogues](http://localhost:3000/two-cataloges)
